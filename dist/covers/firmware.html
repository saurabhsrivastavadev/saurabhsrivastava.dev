        <div class="text-sm space-y-4">
          <p>
            I have been a part of Qualcomm for a bit over 15 years, where I started as an intern right out of college.
            I have worked with several teams on various projects during this long tenure. 
            I have tried to summarize below the projects and experiences which I deem most relevant to firmware development.
          </p>  
          <p>
            I've spent the initial seven years of my career working on Qualcomm Modem Firmware, where I was responsible 
            for feature enhancements and issue debugging on the TCP/IP Protocol Stack. <br/>
            I have worked with the intricacies of the Embedded Firmware on Modem, and the various nuances of working with an
            RTOS lacking the protection of process based memory model.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the next 7+ years working on the Android Framework, where I develop and maintain the Qualcomm Location
            stack, which provides the positioning capabilities to the Android platform. 
            I started with Project Treble, which brought a major architecture change in the Android system design, and provided
            a great place for kickstarting the Android development journey. <br/>
            I have also been involved in developing a couple of Android SDKs to deliver premium location features to customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to working on Android, in the last 7 years I have also architected and developed along with my team,
            the Location stack on Qualcomm's ThreadX and FreeRTOS IoT platforms.<br/>
            These IoT platforms are architected around a variety of unique customer requirements, and have their unique design
            challenges around extremely low memory footprint and power restricted processor usage, built to provide weeks or in 
            some cases months of expected battery life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my role in Android and IoT teams, I worked on developing several ALG (Application Level Gateway) implementations for
            the Qualcomm WIFI platform. <br/>
            These provided a deep understanding of network media protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SDP (Session Description
            Protocol), and RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol). 
          </p>
          <p>
            More importantly, I have been through enough project lifecycles in the last 15 years to understand the importance of people and business 
            aspects of any project, in addition to the software design and implementation aspects, and the fact that the success of 
            any software project requires a balance between these competing forces. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This understanding of making any software project successful, in addition to software design and programming skills, 
            is what I perceive that I bring to the table. 
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>Hope this letter finds you well and, more importantly, your projects in good health.</p>

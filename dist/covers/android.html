        <div class="text-sm space-y-4">
          <p>
            I have been a part of Qualcomm for nearly 14 years, where I started as an intern right out of college.
            I have worked with several teams on various projects during this long tenure. 
            I have tried to summarize below the projects and experiences I deem relevant to this role.
          </p>  
          <p>
            I have spent the last 7 years working on the Android Framework, where I develop and maintain the Qualcomm Location
            stack, which provides the positioning capabilities to the Android platform. <br/>
            I started with Project Treble, which was a great time to start with Android Framework since that major architecture 
            change enabled me to delve deep into the guts of Android. <br/>
            I have also been involved in developing a couple of Android SDKs to deliver premium location features to customers.
            This has enabled a new insight into Android architecture in terms of managing interactions from both Third Party and OEM/System 
            applications with the SDK, and designing modules meant to supervise these applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to working on Android, in the last 7 years I have also owned the Location stack on Qualcomm's ThreadX based
            IoT platform. The unique requirements of IoT platforms, such as very low memory footprint and severe power limitations,
            make you a very cautious developer. That attitude spills over when you work on larger platforms such as Android.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before my role in Android and IoT teams, I worked on developing several ALG (Application Level Gateway) implementations for
            the Qualcomm WIFI platform. <br/>
            These provided a deep understanding of network media protocols such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SDP (Session Description
            Protocol), and RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside the above role in the ALG team, I was part of the team developing and maintaining the TCP/IP stack for the Qualcomm
            Modem platform. This role has provided me a crucial foundational knowledge required for any platform in today's connected world.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            More importantly, I have been through enough project lifecycles in the last 14 years to understand the importance of people and business 
            aspects of any project, in addition to the software design and implementation aspects, and the fact that the success of 
            any software project requires a balance between these competing forces. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This understanding of making any software project successful, in addition to software design and programming skills, 
            is what I perceive that I bring to the table. 
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>Hope this letter finds you well and, more importantly, your projects in good health. Peace.</p>
